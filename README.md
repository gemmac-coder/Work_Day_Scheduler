# Work_Day_Scheduler

## Description

I was tasked to create a dynamic work day scheduler, which allowed employees to plan out their day and add different scheduled tasks to hourly timeblocks.

Each timeblock had to enable the user to input their planned task(s) for the hour and click the save button on the corresponding timeblock row. This user input was then saved to local storage, so the user could refresh the page and see their planned task for a particular hour in the correct timeblock.

The work day scheduler utilised the Moment.js date and time utility library to dynamically show the current day and to dynamically colour-code the timeblock. This dynamic colour-coding depended on whether a timeblock hour was past, present or future in relation to the current time. Timeblocks relating to hours in the past were dynamically coloured grey, the timeblock relating to the current hour was coloured red, and any future timeblocks were dynamically coloured green.

These dynamic features helped to enhance the user experience, whilst helping the user to effectively manage their day.
